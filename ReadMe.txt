Prepare the Directories:

Ensure that the directory containing the .out files (e.g., E:\HANLE) exists and contains files named in the format HANLE_00001.out, HANLE_00020.out, etc.
Ensure that the output directory where the Excel file will be saved (e.g., E:\Excel file) exists and is writable.
Modify the Script:

Update the directory variable to point to the path containing your .out files.
Update the excel_file variable to specify the path and filename for the output Excel file.
Run the Script:

Execute the script in a Python environment.
The script will read the .out files, extract the radiation data, and save it to the specified Excel file.
